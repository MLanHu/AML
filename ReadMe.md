## Introduction
This is a pytorch implementation of binary matching case described in *'Adversarial-Metric Learning for Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Matching'*

## Requirements
python 3.6
librosa 0.7.2
numpy 1.19.0
torch 1.4.0
torchvision 0.5.0

## Dataset
The network are trained on images from the and VGGFace dataset, and audio segments from VoxCeleb1. The VGGFace can be download from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/CMBiometrics/data/zippedFaces.tar.gz). The VoxCeleb1 can be downloaded from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/).
